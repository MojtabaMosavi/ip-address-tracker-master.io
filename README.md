## Overview

### The challenge

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP Address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location

### What I learned

1- Following a style guide that clearly defines how you approach all stylistic aspects of writing code such as commenting. This practise is highly beneficial and advantageous
though is helps to improv the readability and reduce the difficulty of maintanance. For example when is commes to writing css, I usally use 7-1 file architecture and including
a file with overview of what each folder contains and how it functions helps others to get a grasp of it much easily.

2- Object-oriented programmering is great way to split a UI into seperate functioning object. This approach of writing js code allows you to keep your code much more structured
origanized. In this project I tried this approach mixed with the observer pettarn and I am quite happy with the implementation but I am also aware of the fact the there is alot 
of room for improvment. This project was an intro to OOP in js for me.

3- In This project I learned the basics of how to use API in js and asynchronous js. For this project I used the native fetch method but I am looking forward to learn a lot 
more about APIs and how to consum them. The API used in the project required authentication and for securing my authentiaction key I used the npm package.

4- Parcel is "blazing" fast application bunder and in this project I used it for optimizing and minification. For small projects like this parcel is great tool that requires
almost zero configuration in contrast to webpack.

5- Design patterns such as observer pattern and subpub are really powerful and can help you write much more modular code. For instance in this project I got fimiliar to basic
usage of subpub and tried to implement this project based on it but I faced problems that related to asychrounous operations and instead switched to the observer pattern. I am 
looking forward to learn more about design patterns. 


### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1]https://www.educba.com/css-validator/?source=leftnav) - This helped me to understand several css properties such as calc and it's learn more about css properties.
- [Example resource 2](https://wanago.io/2020/01/20/javascript-design-patterns-observer-typescript/) - This is an amazing article for getting started on design patterns.
